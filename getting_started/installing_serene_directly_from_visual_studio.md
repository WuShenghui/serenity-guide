Name your application something like *MyCompany*, *MyProduct*, *HelloWorld* or leave the default *Serene1*.

> Please don't name it *Serenity*. It may conflict with other Serenity assemblies.

Click OK and take a break while Visual Studio downloads the template and creates the solution.

> After you create your first project, Serene template is installed into Visual Studio, so you can use the *Installed* section in *New Project* dialog to create another Serenity application.
